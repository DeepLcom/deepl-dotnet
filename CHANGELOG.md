## [1.12.0] - 2025-01-09
### Added
* Added document minification as a feature before document translation, to 
  allow translation of large docx or pptx files. For more info check the README.

## [1.11.0] - 2024-11-15
### Added
* Added `ModelType` option for text translation to use models with higher
  translation quality (available for some language pairs), or better latency.
  Options are:
  - `ModelType.QualityOptimized ('quality_optimized')`,
  - `ModelType.QualityOptimized ('latency_optimized')`, and
  - `ModelType.QualityOptimized ('prefer_quality_optimized')`
* Added the `ModelTypeUsed` field to text translation response, that
  indicates the translation model used when the `ModelType` option is
  specified.


## [1.10.0] - 2024-09-17
### Added
* Added `BilledCharacters` to the translate text response.


## [1.9.0] - 2024-03-15
### Added
* New language available: Arabic (MSA) (`'ar'`). Add language code constants and tests.

  Note: older library versions also support the new language, this update only
  adds new code constants.
  * [#44](https://github.com/DeepLcom/deepl-dotnet/pull/44) thanks to [Ilmalte](https://github.com/ilmalte)
### Fixed
* Change document upload to use the path `/v2/document` instead of `/v2/document/` (no trailing `/`).
  Both paths will continue to work in the v2 version of the API, but `/v2/document` is the intended one.
* Made `DeepLException` and subclasses, `Usage` and `JsonFieldsStruct` constructors public, to allow for easier mocking of the `ITranslator` interface.
  * [#40](https://github.com/DeepLcom/deepl-dotnet/issues/40) thanks to [PascalVorwerkSaixon](https://github.com/PascalVorwerkSaxion)


## [1.8.0] - 2023-11-03
### Added
* Add optional `Context` parameter for text translation, that specifies
  additional context to influence translations, that is not translated itself.
### Changed
* Improvements to readme examples.


## [1.7.1] - 2023-04-17
### Fixed
* Changed document translation to poll the server every 5 seconds. This should greatly reduce observed document translation processing time.

## [1.7.0] - 2023-03-22
### Added
* Script to check our source code for license headers and a step for them in the CI.
* Added platform and node version information to the user-agent string that is sent with API calls, along with an opt-out.
* Added method for applications that use this library to identify themselves in API requests they make.

## [1.6.0] - 2023-01-26
### Added
* New languages available: Korean (`'ko'`) and Norwegian (bokm√•l) (`'nb'`). Add
  language code constants and tests.

  Note: older library versions also support the new languages, this update only
  adds new code constants.


## [1.5.1] - 2023-01-25
### Fixed
* Fix CI build for netcoreapp3.1.
* Fix `Formality` options `PreferLess` and `PreferMore` for document
  translation.


## [1.5.0] - 2022-09-30
### Added
* Add new `Formality` options: `PreferLess` and `PreferMore`.
### Changed
* Requests resulting in `503 Service Unavailable` errors are now retried.
  Attempting to download a document before translation is completed will now
  wait and retry (up to 5 times by default), rather than throwing an exception.


## [1.4.0] - 2022-09-09
### Added
* New language available: Ukrainian (`'uk'`). Add language code constant and
  tests.

  Note: older library versions also support new languages, this update only
  adds new code constant.


## [1.3.0] - 2022-08-02
### Added
* Add `Translator.createGlossaryFromCsvAsync()` allowing glossaries downloaded
  from website to be easily uploaded to API.
### Changed
* Strong name DeepL.net assembly.


## [1.2.1] - 2022-06-29
### Changed
* Update contributing guidelines, we can now accept Pull Requests.
### Fixed
* Fix bug in OutlineDetection option for text translation.


## [1.2.0] - 2022-05-18
### Added
* New languages available: Indonesian (`'id'`) and Turkish (`'tr'`). Add
  language code constants and tests.

  Note: older library versions also support the new languages, this update only
  adds new code constants.
* Added `ITranslator` interface implemented by `Translator` class, to achieve a
  better mock-ability in conjunction with common mocking frameworks.
### Changed
* Improve package icon, tags and project URLs.
### Fixed
* Test fix: tests should still succeed after new languages are added.


## [1.1.0] - 2022-04-13
### Added
* Add `ErrorMessage` property to `DocumentStatus` that contains a short
  description of document translation error, if available.


## [1.0.5] - 2022-04-12
### Added
* Add support for `TextTranslateOptions.TagHandling = "html"`. No code changes
  were needed, only comments and tests were changed.
* Add test for proxy support.
### Fixed
* Fix some tests that intermittently failed.


## [1.0.4] - 2022-01-27
### Fixed
* Fix issue in .NET versions earlier than 5.0, when creating large glossaries or
 translating texts larger than 64 KiB.


## [1.0.3] - 2022-01-19
### Added
* Add contribution guidelines -- currently we are unable to accept Pull Requests.
### Changed
* Improve README tests section.
