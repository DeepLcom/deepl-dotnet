## [Unreleased]

## [1.17.0] - 2025-11-12
### Added
- Added support for style rules in text translation via the `StyleId` property in `TextTranslateOptions`.
- Added `GetAllStyleRulesAsync()` method to `DeepLClient` to retrieve all available style rules with optional pagination and detailed configuration.
- Added new model classes: `StyleRuleInfo`, `ConfiguredRules`, and `CustomInstruction` to support style rules functionality.

## [1.16.0] - 2025-11-04
### Added
- Added `ExtraBodyParameters` option to text and document translation methods to pass arbitrary parameters in the request body. This can be used to access beta features or override built-in parameters (such as `target_lang`, `source_lang`, etc.).

## [1.15.0] - 2025-04-25
### Added
- Added support for the /v3 Multilingual Glossary APIs in the client library
  while providing backwards compatability for the previous /v2 Glossary
  endpoints. Please refer to the README or
  [upgrading_to_multilingual_glossaries.md](upgrading_to_multilingual_glossaries.md)
  for usage instructions.

## [1.14.0] - 2025-02-25
### Added
- Added support for the `output_format` parameter when translating documents.
  * [#50](https://github.com/DeepLcom/deepl-dotnet/pull/50) thanks for [JuergenRB](https://github.com/JuergenRB)

## [1.13.0] - 2025-01-28
### Added
- Added support for the Write API in the client library, the implementation
  can be found in the `DeepLClient` class. Please refer to the README for usage
  instructions.

### Changed
- The main functionality of the library is now also exposed via the `DeepLClient`
  class. Please change your code to use this over the `Translator` class whenever
  convenient.

### Fixed
- Fixed code example for getting glossary entries in the README
  * [#58](https://github.com/DeepLcom/deepl-dotnet/issues/58) thanks to [KurtBildeSDU](https://github.com/KurtBildeSDU)

## [1.12.0] - 2025-01-09
### Added
- Added document minification as a feature before document translation, to
  allow translation of large docx or pptx files. For more info check the README.

## [1.11.0] - 2024-11-15
### Added
- Added `ModelType` option for text translation to use models with higher
  translation quality (available for some language pairs), or better latency.
  Options are:
  - `ModelType.QualityOptimized ('quality_optimized')`,
  - `ModelType.QualityOptimized ('latency_optimized')`, and
  - `ModelType.QualityOptimized ('prefer_quality_optimized')`
- Added the `ModelTypeUsed` field to text translation response, that
  indicates the translation model used when the `ModelType` option is
  specified.

## [1.10.0] - 2024-09-17
### Added
- Added `BilledCharacters` to the translate text response.

## [1.9.0] - 2024-03-15
### Added
- New language available: Arabic (MSA) (`'ar'`). Add language code constants and tests.

  Note: older library versions also support the new language, this update only
  adds new code constants.
  * [#44](https://github.com/DeepLcom/deepl-dotnet/pull/44) thanks to [Ilmalte](https://github.com/ilmalte)

### Fixed
- Change document upload to use the path `/v2/document` instead of `/v2/document/` (no trailing `/`).
  Both paths will continue to work in the v2 version of the API, but `/v2/document` is the intended one.
- Made `DeepLException` and subclasses, `Usage` and `JsonFieldsStruct` constructors public, to allow for easier mocking of the `ITranslator` interface.
  * [#40](https://github.com/DeepLcom/deepl-dotnet/issues/40) thanks to [PascalVorwerkSaixon](https://github.com/PascalVorwerkSaxion)

## [1.8.0] - 2023-11-03
### Added
- Add optional `Context` parameter for text translation, that specifies
  additional context to influence translations, that is not translated itself.

### Changed
- Improvements to readme examples.

## [1.7.1] - 2023-04-17
### Fixed
- Changed document translation to poll the server every 5 seconds. This should greatly reduce observed document translation processing time.

## [1.7.0] - 2023-03-22
### Added
- Script to check our source code for license headers and a step for them in the CI.
- Added platform and node version information to the user-agent string that is sent with API calls, along with an opt-out.
- Added method for applications that use this library to identify themselves in API requests they make.

## [1.6.0] - 2023-01-26
### Added
- New languages available: Korean (`'ko'`) and Norwegian (bokmål) (`'nb'`). Add
  language code constants and tests.

  Note: older library versions also support the new languages, this update only
  adds new code constants.

## [1.5.1] - 2023-01-25
### Fixed
- Fix CI build for netcoreapp3.1.
- Fix `Formality` options `PreferLess` and `PreferMore` for document
  translation.

## [1.5.0] - 2022-09-30
### Added
- Add new `Formality` options: `PreferLess` and `PreferMore`.

### Changed
- Requests resulting in `503 Service Unavailable` errors are now retried.
  Attempting to download a document before translation is completed will now
  wait and retry (up to 5 times by default), rather than throwing an exception.

## [1.4.0] - 2022-09-09
### Added
- New language available: Ukrainian (`'uk'`). Add language code constant and
  tests.

  Note: older library versions also support new languages, this update only
  adds new code constant.

## [1.3.0] - 2022-08-02
### Added
- Add `Translator.createGlossaryFromCsvAsync()` allowing glossaries downloaded
  from website to be easily uploaded to API.

### Changed
- Strong name DeepL.net assembly.

## [1.2.1] - 2022-06-29
### Changed
- Update contributing guidelines, we can now accept Pull Requests.

### Fixed
- Fix bug in OutlineDetection option for text translation.

## [1.2.0] - 2022-05-18
### Added
- New languages available: Indonesian (`'id'`) and Turkish (`'tr'`). Add
  language code constants and tests.

  Note: older library versions also support the new languages, this update only
  adds new code constants.
- Added `ITranslator` interface implemented by `Translator` class, to achieve a
  better mock-ability in conjunction with common mocking frameworks.

### Changed
- Improve package icon, tags and project URLs.

### Fixed
- Test fix: tests should still succeed after new languages are added.

## [1.1.0] - 2022-04-13
### Added
- Add `ErrorMessage` property to `DocumentStatus` that contains a short
  description of document translation error, if available.

## [1.0.5] - 2022-04-12
### Added
- Add support for `TextTranslateOptions.TagHandling = "html"`. No code changes
  were needed, only comments and tests were changed.
- Add test for proxy support.

### Fixed
- Fix some tests that intermittently failed.

## [1.0.4] - 2022-01-27
### Fixed
- Fix issue in .NET versions earlier than 5.0, when creating large glossaries or
   translating texts larger than 64 KiB.

## [1.0.3] - 2022-01-19
### Added
- Add contribution guidelines -- currently we are unable to accept Pull Requests.

### Changed
