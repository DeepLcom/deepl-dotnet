[![.NET](https://github.com/DeepLcom/deepl-dotnet/actions/workflows/build_default.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/DeepLcom/deepl-dotnet/actions/workflows/build_default.yml)

The [DeepL API](https://www.deepl.com/docs-api?utm_source=github&utm_medium=github-dotnet-readme) is a language
AI API that allows other computer programs to send texts and documents to DeepL's servers and receive
high-quality translations and improvements to the text. This opens a whole universe of opportunities
for developers: any translation product you can imagine can now be built on top of DeepL's best-in-class
translation technology.

The DeepL .NET library offers a convenient way for applications written in .NET to interact with the DeepL API. We
intend to support all API functions with the library, though support for new features may be added to the library after
they’re added to the API.

## Getting an authentication key

To use the DeepL .NET Library, you'll need an API authentication key. To get a key,
[please create an account here](https://www.deepl.com/pro?utm_source=github&utm_medium=github-dotnet-readme#developer).
With a DeepL API Free account you can consume up to 500,000 characters/month for free.

## Installation

Using the .NET Core command-line interface (CLI) tools:

```
dotnet add package DeepL.net
```

Using the NuGet Command Line Interface (CLI):

```
nuget install DeepL.net
```

## Usage

All entities in the DeepL .NET library are in the `DeepL` namespace:

```c#
using DeepL;
```

Create a `DeepLClient` object providing your DeepL API authentication key.

Be careful not to expose your key, for example when sharing source code.

```c#
var authKey = "f63c02c5-f056-..."; // Replace with your key
var client = new DeepLClient(authKey);
```

This example is for demonstration purposes only. In production code, the authentication key should not be hard-coded,
but instead fetched from a configuration file or environment variable.

`DeepLClient` accepts options as the second argument, see [Configuration](#configuration) for more information.

### Translating text

To translate text, call `TranslateTextAsync()`. The first argument is a string containing the text to translate, or
`IEnumerable` of strings to translate multiple texts.

The second and third arguments are case-insensitive language codes for the source and target language respectively,
for example `"DE"`, `"FR"`.
The `LanguageCode` static class defines constants for the currently supported languages, for example
`LanguageCode.German`, `LanguageCode.French`.
To auto-detect the input text language, specify `null` as the source language.

Additional `TextTranslateOptions` can also be provided, see [Text translation options](#text-translation-options) below.

`TranslateTextAsync()` returns a `TextResult` or `TextResult` array corresponding to the input text(s).
The `TextResult` contains:

- the translated text,
- the detected source language code,
- the number of characters billed for the text, and
- the translation model type used (only non-null if the ModelType option is specified.)

```c#
// Translate text into a target language, in this case, French:
var translatedText = await client.TranslateTextAsync(
      "Hello, world!",
      LanguageCode.English,
      LanguageCode.French);
Console.WriteLine(translatedText); // "Bonjour, le monde !"
// Note: printing or converting the result to a string uses the output text.

// Translate multiple texts into British English:
var translations = await client.TranslateTextAsync(
      new[] { "お元気ですか？", "¿Cómo estás?" }, null, "EN-GB");
Console.WriteLine(translations[0].Text); // "How are you?"
Console.WriteLine(translations[0].DetectedSourceLanguageCode); // "JA"
Console.WriteLine(translations[0].BilledCharacters); // 7 - the number of characters in the source text "お元気ですか？"
Console.WriteLine(translations[1].Text); // "How are you?"
Console.WriteLine(translations[1].DetectedSourceLanguageCode); // "ES"
Console.WriteLine(translations[1].BilledCharacters); // 12 - the number of characters in the source text "¿Cómo estás?"

// Translate into German with less and more Formality:
foreach (var formality in new[] { Formality.Less, Formality.More }) {
  Console.WriteLine(
        await client.TranslateTextAsync(
              "How are you?",
              null,
              LanguageCode.German,
              new TextTranslateOptions { Formality = formality }));
}
// Will print: "Wie geht es dir?" "Wie geht es Ihnen?"
```

#### Text translation options

`TextTranslateOptions` has the following properties that impact text translation:

- `SentenceSplittingMode`: specifies how input text should be split into
  sentences, default: `'SentenceSplittingMode.All'`.
  - `SentenceSplittingMode.All`: input text will be split into sentences using
    both newlines and punctuation.
  - `SentenceSplittingMode.Off`: input text will not be split into sentences.
    Use this for applications where each input text contains only one
    sentence.
  - `SentenceSplittingMode.NoNewlines`: input text will be split into
    sentences using punctuation but not newlines.
- `PreserveFormatting`: controls automatic-formatting-correction. Set to
  `true` to prevent automatic-correction of formatting, default: `false`.
- `Formality`: controls whether translations should lean toward informal or
  formal language. This option is only available for some target languages, see
  [Listing available languages](#listing-available-languages).
  - `Formality.Less`: use informal language.
  - `Formality.More`: use formal, more polite language.
  - `Formality.Default`: standard level of formality.
  - `Formality.PreferLess`: less formality, if available for the specified target language, otherwise default.
  - `Formality.PreferMore`: more formality, if available for the specified target language, otherwise default.
- `GlossaryId`: specifies a glossary to use with translation, as a string
  containing the glossary ID.
- `StyleId`: specifies a style rule to use with translation, as a string
  containing the ID of the style rule.
- `Context`: specifies additional context to influence translations, that is not
  translated itself. Characters in the `context` parameter are not counted toward billing.
  See the [API documentation][api-docs-context-param] for more information and
  example usage.
- `CustomInstructions`: an array of instructions to customize the translation behavior.
  Up to 10 custom instructions can be specified, each with a maximum of 300 characters.
  Important: The target language must be `de`, `en`, `es`, `fr`, `it`, `ja`, `ko`, `zh`
  or any variants of these languages.
  Note: Any request with the `CustomInstructions` parameter enabled will use
  `quality_optimized` models as the default. Requests combining 
  `CustomInstructions` and `ModelType: latency_optimized` will be rejected.
- `ModelType`: specifies the type of translation model to use, options are:
  - `'quality_optimized'` (`ModelType.QualityOptimized`): use a translation
    model that maximizes translation quality, at the cost of response time.
    This option may be unavailable for some language pairs.
  - `'prefer_quality_optimized'` (`ModelType.PreferQualityOptimized`): use
    the highest-quality translation model for the given language pair.
  - `'latency_optimized'` (`ModelType.LatencyOptimized`): use a translation
    model that minimizes response time, at the cost of translation quality.
- `TagHandling`: type of tags to parse before translation, options are
  `"html"` and `"xml"`.
- `TagHandlingVersion`: specifies which version of the tag handling algorithm
  to use. Options are `"v1"` and `"v2"`. This parameter is only used if
  `TagHandling` is set to `"html"` or `"xml"`.

The following options are only used if `TagHandling` is set to `'xml'`:

- `OutlineDetection`: set to `false` to disable automatic tag detection,
  default is `true`.
- `SplittingTags`: `List` of XML tags that should be used to split text into
  sentences. Tags may be specified individually (`['tag1', 'tag2']`),
  or a comma-separated list of strings (`'tag1,tag2'`). The default is an empty
  list.
- `NonSplittingTags`: `List` of XML tags that should not be used to split
  text into sentences. Format and default are the same as for splitting tags.
- `IgnoreTags`: `List` of XML tags that containing content that should not be
  translated. Format and default are the same as for splitting tags.
- `ExtraBodyParameters`: `Dictionary<string, string>` of extra parameters to pass in the body of the HTTP request. Keys
  in this dictionary will be added to the request body and can override built-in parameters. Mostly used by DeepL
  employees to test functionality, or for beta programs.

For a detailed explanation of the XML handling options, see the [API documentation][api-docs-xml-handling].

### Improving text (Write API)

You can use the Write API to improve or rephrase text. This is implemented in
the `RephraseTextAsync()` method. The first argument is a string containing the text
you want to translate, or a list of strings if you want to translate multiple texts.

`targetLanguageCode` optionally specifies the target language, e.g. when you want to change
the variant of a text (for example, you can send an english text to the write API and
use `targetLanguageCode` to turn it into British or American English). Please note that the
Write API itself does NOT translate. If you wish to translate and improve a text, you
will need to make multiple calls in a chain.

Language codes are the same as for translating text.

Example call:

```c#
WriteResult result = await client.RephraseTextAsync("A rainbouw has seven colours.", "EN-US");
Console.WriteLine(result);
```

Additionally, you can optionally specify a style OR a tone (not both at once) that the
improvement should be in. The following styles are supported (`default` will be used if
nothing is selected):

- `academic`
- `business`
- `casual`
- `default`
- `simple`

The following tones are supported (`default` will be used if nothing is selected):

- `confident`
- `default`
- `diplomatic`
- `enthusiastic`
- `friendly`

You can also prefix any non-default style or tone with `prefer_` (`prefer_academic`, etc.),
in which case the style/tone will only be applied if the language supports it. If you do not
use `prefer_`, requests with `targetLanguageCode`s or detected languages that do not support
styles and tones will fail. The current list of supported languages can be found in our
[API documentation][api-docs]. We plan to also expose this information via an API endpoint
in the future.

You can pass a style like so:

```c#
var options = new TextRephraseOptions { WritingStyle = "business" }
var result = await client.RephraseTextAsync("A rainbouw has seven colours.", "EN-US", options);
Console.WriteLine(result);
```

### Translating documents

To translate documents, call `TranslateDocumentAsync()` with the input and output files as `FileInfo`
objects, and provide the source and target language as above.

Additional `DocumentTranslateOptions` are also available,
see [Document translation options](#document-translation-options) below.
Note that file paths are not accepted as strings, to avoid mixing up the file and language arguments.

```c#
// Translate a formal document from English to German
try {
  await client.TranslateDocumentAsync(
        new FileInfo("Instruction Manual.docx"),
        new FileInfo("Bedienungsanleitung.docx"),
        "EN",
        "DE",
        new DocumentTranslateOptions { Formality = Formality.More });
} catch (DocumentTranslationException exception) {
  // If the error occurs *after* upload, the DocumentHandle will contain the document ID and key
  if (exception.DocumentHandle != null) {
    var handle = exception.DocumentHandle.Value;
    Console.WriteLine($"Document ID: {handle.DocumentId}, Document key: {handle.DocumentKey}");
  } else {
    Console.WriteLine($"Error occurred during document upload: {exception.Message}");
  }
}
```

Alternatively the input and output files may be provided as `Stream` objects; in
that case the input file name (or extension) is required, so the DeepL API can
determine the file type:

```c#
...
  using var outputFile = File.OpenWrite(outputDocumentPath);
  await client.TranslateDocumentAsync(
        new MemoryStream(buffer),
        "Input file.docx", // An extension like ".docx" is also sufficient
        outputFile,
        "EN",
        "DE",
        new DocumentTranslateOptions { Formality = Formality.More });
```

`TranslateDocumentAsync()` manages the upload, wait until translation is complete, and download steps. If your
application needs to execute these steps individually, you can instead use the following functions directly:

- `TranslateDocumentUploadAsync()`,
- `TranslateDocumentStatusAsync()` (or `TranslateDocumentWaitUntilDoneAsync()`), and
- `TranslateDocumentDownloadAsync()`

#### Document translation options

`DocumentTranslateOptions` has the following properties that impact text translation:

- `Formality`:  same as in [Text translation options](#text-translation-options).
- `GlossaryId`:  same as in [Text translation options](#text-translation-options).
- `EnableDocumentMinification`: A `bool` value. If set to `true`, the library will try to minify a document
  before translating it through the API, sending a smaller document if the file contains a lot of media. This is
  currently only supported for `pptx` and `docx` files. See also [Document minification](#document-minification).
  Note that this only works in the high-level `TranslateDocumentDownloadAsync` method, not
  `TranslateDocumentUploadAsync`. However, the behavior can be emulated by creating a new `DocumentMinifier`
  object and calling the minifier's methods in between.
- `OutputFormat`: using the parameter during document upload, you can select alternative output formats. See
  the [API documentation][api-docs-outputformat-param] for more information and example usage.
- `ExtraBodyParameters`: `Dictionary<string, string>` of extra parameters to pass in the body of the HTTP request. Keys
  in this dictionary will be added to the request body and can override built-in parameters. Mostly used by DeepL
  employees to test functionality, or for beta programs.

#### Document minification

In some contexts, one can end up with large document files (e.g. PowerPoint presentations
or Word files with many contributors, especially in a larger organization). However, the
DeepL API enforces a limit of 30 MB for most of these files (see Usage Limits in the docs).
In the case that most of this size comes from media included in the documents (e.g. images,
videos, animations), document minification can help.
In this case, the library will create a temporary directory to extract the document into,
replace the large media with tiny placeholders, create a minified document, translate that
via the API, and re-insert the original media into the original file. Please note that this
requires a bit of additional (temporary) disk space, we recommend at least 2x the file size
of the document to be translated.
To use document minification, simply pass the option to the `TranslateDocumentAsync` function:

```c#
await client.TranslateDocumentAsync(
    inFile, outFile, "EN", "DE", new DocumentTranslateOptions { EnableDocumentMinification = true }
);
```

In order to use document minification with the lower-level `TranslateDocumentUploadAsync`,
`TranslateDocumentWaitUntilDoneAsync` and `TranslateDocumentDownloadAsync` methods as well as other details,
see the `DocumentMinifier` class.
Currently supported document types for minification:

1. `pptx`
2. `docx`
   Currently supported media types for minification:
1. `png`
2. `jpg`
3. `jpeg`
4. `emf`
5. `bmp`
6. `tiff`
7. `wdp`
8. `svg`
9. `gif`
10. `mp4`
11. `asf`
12. `avi`
13. `m4v`
14. `mpg`
15. `mpeg`
16. `wmv`
17. `mov`
18. `aiff`
19. `au`
20. `mid`
21. `midi`
22. `mp3`
23. `m4a`
24. `wav`
25. `wma`

### Glossaries

Glossaries allow you to customize your translations using defined terms.
Multiple glossaries can be stored with your account, each with a user-specified name and a uniquely-assigned ID.

### v2 versus v3 glossary APIs

The newest version of the glossary APIs are the `/v3` endpoints, allowing both
editing functionality plus support for multilingual glossaries. New methods and
objects have been created to support interacting with these new glossaries.
Due to this new functionality, users are recommended to utilize these
multilingual glossary methods. However, to continue using the `v2` glossary API
endpoints, please continue to use the existing endpoints in the `Translator.cs`
(e.g. `CreateGlossaryAsync()`, `GetGlossaryAsync()`, etc).

To migrate to use the new multilingual glossary methods from the current
monolingual glossary methods, please refer to
[this migration guide](upgrading_to_multilingual_glossaries.md).

The following sections describe how to interact with multilingual glossaries
using the new functionality:

#### Creating a glossary

You can create a glossary with your desired terms and name using
`CreateMultilingualGlossaryAsync()`. Each glossary applies to a single source-target language
pair. Note: Glossaries are only supported for some language pairs, see
[Listing available glossary languages](#listing-available-glossary-languages)
for more information. The entries should be specified as a `Dictionary`.

If successful, the glossary is created and stored with your DeepL account, and
a `MultilingualGlossaryInfo` object is returned including the ID, name, languages and entry
count.

```c#
// Create a glossary with an English to German dictionary containing two terms:
var entriesDictionary = new Dictionary<string, string>{{"artist", "Maler"}, {"prize", "Gewinn"}};
var glossaryDicts = new[] {new MultilingualGlossaryDictionaryEntries(
  "EN", "DE", new GlossaryEntries(entriesDictionary))};
var glossaryEnToDe = await client.CreateMultilingualGlossaryAsync("My glossary", glossaryDicts);

var glossaryDictEnToDe = glossaryEnToDe.Dictionaries[0]
Console.WriteLine($"Created {glossaryEnToDe.Name}' ({glossaryEnToDe.GlossaryId}) " +
    $"with {glossaryEnToDe.Dictionaries.Length} dictionary where its language pair is "
    $"{glossaryDictEnToDe.SourceLanguageCode}->{glossaryDictEnToDe.TargetLanguageCode} " +
    $"containing {glossaryDictEnToDe.EntryCount} entries"
);
// Example: Created 'My glossary' (559192ed-8e23-...) with 1 dictionary where
// its language pair is EN->DE containing 2 entries

You can also upload a glossary downloaded from the DeepL website using
`CreateMultilingualGlossaryFromCsvAsync()`. Instead of supplying the entries as a dictionary,
specify the CSV data as a `Stream` containing file content:

```c#
var csvStream =  File.OpenRead("myGlossary.csv");
var csvGlossary = await client.CreateMultilingualGlossaryFromCsvAsync("My CSV glossary", "EN", "DE", csvStream);
```

The [API documentation][api-docs-csv-format] explains the expected CSV format in detail.

#### Getting, listing and deleting stored glossaries

Functions to get, list, and delete stored glossaries are also provided:

- `GetMultilingualGlossaryAsync()` takes a glossary ID and returns a
  `MultilingualGlossaryInfo` object for a stored glossary, or raises an
  exception if no such glossary is found.
- `ListMultilingualGlossariesAsync()` returns a `List` of
  `MultilingualGlossaryInfo` objects corresponding to all of your stored
  glossaries.
- `DeleteMultilingualGlossaryAsync()` takes a glossary ID or
  `MultilingualGlossaryInfo` object and deletes the stored glossary from the
  server, or raises an exception if no such glossary is found.
- `DeleteMultilingualGlossaryDictionaryAsync()` takes a glossary ID or
  `MultilingualGlossaryInfo` object to identify the glossary. Additionally
  takes in a source and target language or a
  `MultilingualGlossaryDictionaryInfo` object and deletes the stored dictionary
  from the server, or raises an exception if no such glossary dictionary is
  found.

```c#
// Retrieve a stored glossary using the ID
var myGlossary = await client.GetMultilingualGlossaryAsync("559192ed-8e23-...");

// Delete a glossary dictionary from a stored glossary
await client.DeleteMultilingualGlossaryDictionaryAsync(myGlossary, myGlossary.Dictionaries[0]);

// Find and delete glossaries named 'Old glossary'
var glossaries = await client.ListMultilingualGlossariesAsync();
foreach (var glossaryInfo in glossaries) {
  if (glossaryInfo.Name == "Old glossary")
    await client.DeleteMultilingualGlossaryAsync(glossaryInfo);
}
```

#### Listing entries in a stored glossary

The `MultilingualGlossaryDictionaryInfo` object does not contain the glossary entries, but instead
only the number of entries in the `EntryCount` property.

To list the entries contained within a stored glossary, use
`GetMultilingualGlossaryDictionaryEntriesAsync()` providing either the `MultilingualGlossaryInfo` object or glossary ID
and either a `MultilingualGlossaryDictionaryInfo` or source and target language pair:

```c#
var glossaryDicts = await client.GetMultilingualGlossaryDictionaryEntriesAsync(myGlossary, "en", "de");

foreach (KeyValuePair<string, string> entry in glossaryDicts[0].Entries.ToDictionary()) {
  Console.WriteLine($"{entry.Key}: {entry.Value}");
}
// prints:
//   artist: Maler
//   prize: Gewinn
```

#### Editing a glossary

Functions to edit stored glossaries are also provided:

- `UpdateMultilingualGlossaryDictionaryAsync()` takes a glossary ID or `MultilingualGlossaryInfo`
  object, plus a source language, target language, and a dictionary of entries.
  It will then either update the list of entries for that dictionary (either
  inserting new entires or replacing the target phrase for any existing
  entries) or will insert a new glossary dictionary if that language pair is
  not currently in the stored glossary.
- `ReplaceMultilingualGlossaryDictionaryAsync()` takes a glossary ID or `MultilingualGlossaryInfo`
  object, plus a source language, target language, and a dictionary of entries.
  It will then either set the entries to the parameter value, completely
  replacing any pre-existing entries for that language pair.
- `UpdateMultilingualGlossaryNameAsync()` takes a glossary ID or `MultilingualGlossaryInfo`
  object, plus the new name of the glossary.

```c#
// Update glossary dictionary
var entries = new Dictionary<string, string>{{"artist", "Maler"}, {"hello", "guten tag"}};
var dictionaries = new[] {new MultilingualGlossaryDictionaryEntries("EN", "DE", entries)};
var myGlossary = await client.CreateMultilingualGlossaryAsync(
    "My glossary",
    dictionaries
);
var newEntries = new Dictionary<string, string>{{"hello", "hallo"}, {"prize", "Gewinn"}};
var glossaryDict = new MultilingualGlossaryDictionaryEntries("EN", "DE", newEntries);
var updatedGlossary = await client.UpdateMultilingualGlossaryDictionaryAsync(
    myGlossary,
    glossaryDict
);

var entriesResponse = await client.GetMultilingualGlossaryEntriesAsync(myGlossary, "EN", "DE");

foreach (KeyValuePair<string, string> entry in entriesResponse.Dictionaries[0].Entries.ToDictionary()) {
  Console.WriteLine($"{entry.Key}: {entry.Value}");
}
// prints:
//   artist: Maler
//   hello: hallo
//   prize: Gewinn

// Update a glossary dictionary from CSV
var csvStream =  File.OpenRead("myGlossary.csv");
var csvGlossary = await client.UpdateMultilingualGlossaryDictionaryFromCsvAsync("4c81ffb4-2e...", "EN", "DE", csvStream);

// Replace glossary dictionary
var replacementEntries = new Dictionary<string, string>{{"goodbye", "Auf Wiedersehen"}};
var glossaryDict = new MultilingualGlossaryDictionaryEntries("EN", "DE", new GlossaryEntries(replacementEntries));
var updatedGlossary = await client.ReplaceMultilingualGlossaryDictionaryAsync(
  myGlossary,
  glossaryDict);
var entriesResponse = await client.GetMultilingualGlossaryEntries(myGlossary, "EN", "DE");
foreach (KeyValuePair<string, string> entry in entriesResponse.Dictionaries[0].Entries.ToDictionary()) {
  Console.WriteLine($"{entry.Key}: {entry.Value}");
}
// prints:
//   goodbye: Auf Wiedersehen

// Replace a glossary dictionary from CSV
var csvStream =  File.OpenRead("myGlossary.csv");
var csvGlossary = await client.ReplaceMultilingualGlossaryDictionaryFromCsvAsync("4c81ffb4-2e...", "EN", "DE", csvStream);

// Update the glossary name
var updatedGlossary = await client.UpdateMultilingualGlossaryNameAsync(
  myGlossary,
  "My new glossary name"
);
Console.WriteLine(updatedGlossary.Name); // 'My new glossary name'
```

#### Using a stored glossary

You can use a stored glossary for text (or document) translation by setting the
`TextTranslationOptions` (or `DocumentTranslationOptions`) `GlossaryId` property
to the glossary ID. You must also specify the `source_lang` argument (it is
required when using a glossary):

```c#
var resultWithGlossary = await client.TranslateTextAsync(
    "The artist was awarded a prize.",
    "EN",
    "DE",
    new TextTranslateOptions { GlossaryId = glossaryEnToDe.GlossaryId });
// resultWithGlossary.Text == "Der Maler wurde mit einem Gewinn ausgezeichnet."
// Without using a glossary: "Der Künstler wurde mit einem Preis ausgezeichnet."
```

### Style Rules

Style rules allow you to customize your translations using a managed, shared list
of rules for style, formatting, and more. Multiple style rules can be stored with
your account, each with a user-specified name and a uniquely-assigned ID.

#### Creating and managing style rules

Currently style rules must be created and managed in the DeepL UI via
https://www.deepl.com/en/custom-rules. Full CRUD functionality via the APIs will
come shortly.

#### Listing all style rules

`GetAllStyleRulesAsync()` returns a list of `StyleRuleInfo` objects
corresponding to all of your stored style rules. The method accepts optional
parameters: `page` (page number for pagination, 0-indexed), `pageSize` (number
of items per page), and `detailed` (whether to include detailed configuration
rules in the `ConfiguredRules` property).

```c#
// Get all style rules
var styleRules = await client.GetAllStyleRulesAsync();
foreach (var rule in styleRules) {
  Console.WriteLine($"{rule.Name} ({rule.StyleId})");
}

// Get style rules with detailed configuration
var styleRulesDetailed = await client.GetAllStyleRulesAsync(detailed: true);
foreach (var rule in styleRulesDetailed) {
  if (rule.ConfiguredRules?.Numbers != null) {
    Console.WriteLine($"  Number formatting rules: {string.Join(", ", rule.ConfiguredRules.Numbers.Keys)}");
  }
}
```

### Check account usage

```c#
var usage = await client.GetUsageAsync();
if (usage.AnyLimitReached) {
  Console.WriteLine("Translation limit exceeded.");
} else if (usage.Character != null) {
  Console.WriteLine($"Character usage: {usage.Character}");
} else {
  Console.WriteLine($"{usage}");
}
```

### Listing available languages

You can request the list of languages supported by DeepL for text and documents
using the `GetSourceLanguagesAsync()` and `GetTargetLanguagesAsync()` functions.
They both return a list of `Language` objects.

The `Name` property gives the name of the language in English, and the `Code`
property gives the language code. The `SupportsFormality` property only appears
for target languages, and indicates whether the target language supports the
optional `Formality` parameter.

```c#
// Source and target languages
var sourceLanguages = await client.GetSourceLanguagesAsync();
foreach (var lang in sourceLanguages) {
  Console.WriteLine($"{lang.Name} ({lang.Code})"); // Example: "English (EN)"
}
var targetLanguages = await client.GetTargetLanguagesAsync();
foreach (var lang in targetLanguages) {
  if (lang.SupportsFormality ?? false) {
    Console.WriteLine($"{lang.Name} ({lang.Code}) supports formality");
     // Example: "German (DE) supports formality"
  }
}
```

#### Listing available glossary languages

Glossaries are supported for a subset of language pairs. To retrieve those
languages use the `GetGlossaryLanguagesAsync()` function, which returns an array
of `GlossaryLanguagePair` objects. Use the `SourceLanguage` and
`TargetLanguage` properties to check the pair of language codes supported.

```c#

// Glossary languages
var glossaryLanguages = await client.GetGlossaryLanguagesAsync();
foreach (var languagePair in glossaryLanguages) {
  Console.WriteLine($"{languagePair.SourceLanguage} to {languagePair.TargetLanguage}");
  // Example: "EN to DE", "DE to EN", etc.
}
```

You can also find the list of supported glossary language pairs in the
[API documentation][api-docs-glossary-lang-list].

Note that glossaries work for all target regional-variants: a glossary for the
target language English (`"EN"`) supports translations to both American English
(`"EN-US"`) and British English (`"EN-GB"`).

### Exceptions

All library functions may raise `DeepLException` or one of its subclasses. If
invalid arguments are provided, they may raise the standard exceptions
`ArgumentException`.

### Writing a Plugin

If you use this library in an application, please identify the application with
`DeepLClientOptions.appInfo`, which needs the name and version of the app:

```c#
var options = new DeepLClientOptions {
  appInfo =  new AppInfo { AppName = "my-dotnet-test-app", AppVersion = "1.2.3"}
};
var client = new DeepLClient(AuthKey, options);
```

This information is passed along when the library makes calls to the DeepL API.
Both name and version are required. Please note that setting the `User-Agent` header
via `DeepLClientOptions.Headers` will override this setting, if you need to use this,
please manually identify your Application in the `User-Agent` header.

### Configuration

The `DeepLClient` constructor accepts `DeepLClientOptions` as a second argument,
for example:

```c#
var options = new DeepLClientOptions {
      MaximumNetworkRetries = 5,
      PerRetryConnectionTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10),
};
var client = new DeepLClient(authKey, options);
```

See the `DeepLClientOptions` class for details about the available options.

#### Proxy configuration

To use the library with a proxy, override the `ClientFactory` with a function returning a custom `HttpClient`:

```c#
var proxyUrl = "http://localhost:3001";
var handler = new System.Net.Http.HttpClientHandler {
      Proxy = new System.Net.WebProxy(proxyUrl), UseProxy = true,
};
var options = new DeepLClientOptions {
      ClientFactory = () => new HttpClientAndDisposeFlag {
            HttpClient = new HttpClient(handler), DisposeClient = true,
      }
};
var client = new DeepLClient(authKey, options);
```

#### Anonymous platform information

By default, we send some basic information about the platform the client library is running
on with each request,
see [here for an explanation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent).
This data is completely anonymous and only used to improve our product, not track any
individual users. If you do not wish to send this data, you can opt-out when creating
your `DeepLClient` object by setting the `sendPlatformInfo` flag in the
`DeepLClientOptions` to `false` like so:

```c#
var options = new DeepLClientOptions { sendPlatformInfo = false };
var client = new DeepLClient(authKey, options);
```

## Issues

If you experience problems using the library, or would like to request a new feature, please open an
[issue][issues].

## Development

We welcome Pull Requests, please read the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Tests

Execute the tests using `dotnet test`. The tests communicate with the DeepL API using the auth key defined by the
`DEEPL_AUTH_KEY` environment variable.

Be aware that the tests make DeepL API requests that contribute toward your API usage.

The test suite may instead be configured to communicate with the mock-server provided by
[deepl-mock](https://www.github.com/DeepLcom/deepl-mock). Although most test cases work for either, some test cases work
only with the DeepL API or the mock-server and will be otherwise skipped. The test cases that require the mock-server
trigger server errors and test the client error-handling. To execute the tests using deepl-mock, run it in another
terminal while executing the tests. Execute the tests using `dotnet test` with the `DEEPL_MOCK_SERVER_PORT` and
`DEEPL_SERVER_URL` environment variables defined referring to the mock-server.
